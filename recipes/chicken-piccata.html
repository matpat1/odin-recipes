            thick.</li></p>
            <p><li>Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt, and black pepper; dredge 
            lightly in flour and shake off any excess.</li></p>
            <p><li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the pan, reduce 
            heat to medium, and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side;
